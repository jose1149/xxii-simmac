On this tutorial, we will be learning about Parallel Computing using R, mainly the library __Rmpi__ (https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rmpi), however, we will also have a quick exploration on some other relevant libraries like __foreach__ (https://cran.r-project.org/package=foreach) and __doParallel__ (https://cran.r-project.org/package=doParallel).
