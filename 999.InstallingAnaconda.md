# Installing Anaconda

If you are afraid of snakes üêç, there is no need to worry, Anaconda is going to be your best mate. What a wonderful time to be alive ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Let's start by installing Anaconda:
1. Download the appropriate version for your operating system from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
    - I recommend downloading the version for Python 3.7 as 2.7 is not (officially) supported anymore ‚òπÔ∏è 
2. Read the 765072057 pages of *user agreement terms and conditions* and _Accept_ them (you have no choice) üòé
3. Then, click on any *Next* button you see.
4. You are done.

# Setting up the workspace
Next, we are going to create a virtual environment (think of a box üì¶ where you keep your tools üß∞) with Anaconda. 
1. Download the [`environment.yml`](environment.yml) file to your workstation.

2. Open Anaconda Navigator

3. Click on *Environments* (left panel)
    
    <img src="images/anaconda-navigator-environments.png" alt="anaconda-navigator-environments" width=200px />
    
4. Click on *Import* (bottom panel)

    <img src="images/import-environment.png" alt="import-environment" width=300px />
    
5. Click on the folder üìÅ icon and find the [`environment.yml`](environment.yml) file, previously downloaded. Finally, click on *Import*.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è This might take some time!
    

## Alternative method
1. Open Anaconda Navigator

2. Launch an instance of Spyder (click on Launch)
    
    <img src="images/spyder.png" alt="spyder" width=200px />

    Somewhere (ideally on the bottom right corner), you will see a window called _IPython console_ similar to one shown below:
     
    ![ipython-console](images/ipython-console.png)

3. Execute the following command:
    ```bash
    conda env create --name ENVIRONMENT_NAME --file=/PATH/TO/environment.yml
    ```
    
    e.g.
    ```bash
    conda env create --name SIMMAC --file=/Users/roberto.villegas-diaz/Downloads/environment.yml
    ```
    
    The [`environment.yml`](environment.yml) file has to be downloaded first.
    
4. (Alternative) Execute the following (line by line please) commands:

    ```bash
    conda create -n SIMMAC # Create a virtual environment called SIMMAC
    source activate SIMMAC # Activate the virtual environment
    
    # Install Python and R packages
    conda install -c conda-forge ipyslurm -y
    conda install -c anaconda pandas -y
    conda install -c r r-irkernel -y
    conda install -c conda-forge jupyter -y
    conda install -c conda-forge r-rmpi -y
    conda install -c r r-doparallel -y
    conda install -c r r-foreach -y
    conda install -c r r-tictoc -y
    ```
