# Before the Tutorial

The day has finally arrived, it is showtime! ðŸ¤“

But first, some housekeeping before diving into the amazing world of HPC! Yesterday (hopefully), you got an email with some information about [Getting Started](0.GettingStarted.md), if you haven't had time to have a look, please do so, before we can move on.

Now, I just need you to do one more thing, download the latest version of the files we will be using during the tutorial. Follow the instructions below:

1. Navigate to https://kabre.cenat.ac.cr:8000
