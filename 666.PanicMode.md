# Panic Mode

If you are here it means one of two things happened:

1. You didn't get an account on KABRÉ 😢 
2. You got an account, but nothing seems to be working on KABRÉ 😱

I'm here to help you, so don't worry (I know the title says something else 😅). For this circumstance we have two alternatives:

1. Run the Notebook on Binder (https://mybinder.org) just click on the button below

    [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/villegar/xxii-simmac/master?filepath=HPCwRmpi.ipynb)

    ⚠️ It takes some time (minutes) to start Binder, some stuff has to be installed in the background, like creating and deploying a [Docker](http://docker.com) container 🐳  
2. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) on your workstation and run there, I'm afraid no fancy _MPI_ for you in this case. I have created the following tutorial for [Installing Anaconda](999.InstallingAnaconda.md) and deploying the packages on this tutorial.
